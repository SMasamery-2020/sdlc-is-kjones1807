What is SDLC?
SDLC stands for "Systems development life cycle". It is the way products are planned, created, tested, and deployed (usually in IT, and software development).


What are the stages of SDLC? explain 
Some common stages are...
1. Planning
2. Define Requirements
3. Design & Prototyping 
4. Software Development
5. Testing
6. Deployment
7. Operations & Maintenence
First you have to plan, set limits to, and design your product. Then you can make out a prototype and start with the testing. Then you put your product ou there and maintain it.


Define five SDLC moldels (methodology).
1. Agile: "Fast Failure" approach where they release a product for testing quickly and then work out the kinks and make big improvements.
2. Lean: "One step of a time" aproach where you work on one part of the plan at a time.
3. Waterfall: "Don't live in the past" approach where you finish one part of the process and move on to the next without going back (older method).
4. Iterative: "Rinse, lather, repeat" approach where you repeat many steps until you get what you like.
5. Spiral: "Ascending Spiral" approach where it's reptition mixed with doing all 4 processes over and over until complete.


Take one of the SDLC models and explain the implementation process.
The way to implement lean is to you start a particular stage of SDLC and stick to it until you are done. Don't move on to the next step until you're done.


Describe how to apply SDLC model in the version control App.
